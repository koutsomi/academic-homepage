I am a **tenured** **Lab Lecturer** at the [Department of Computer
Engineering and Informatics](http://www.ceid.upatras.gr/) and a
**research associate** at the [High Performance Information Systems
Laboratory (HPCLab)](../index.html) and the [Pattern Recognition
Laboratory (PRLab)](http://prlab.ceid.upatras.gr/), [University of
Patras](http://www.upatras.gr/). I had formerly been an **Adjunct
Assistant Professor** (2008-2013) and a **visiting postdoctoral fellow**
(2013-2017). I have received a diploma, an M.Sc. and a
fellowship-awarded Ph.D. from the same department, specializing in
knowledge management and discovery on the Web.
