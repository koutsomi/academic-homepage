I am a **tenured** **Lab Lecturer** at the [Department of Computer
Engineering and Informatics](http://www.ceid.upatras.gr/) and a
**research associate** at the [High Performance Information Systems
Laboratory (HPCLab)](../index.html) and the [Pattern Recognition
Laboratory (PRLab)](http://prlab.ceid.upatras.gr/), [University of
Patras](http://www.upatras.gr/). I had formerly been an **Adjunct
Assistant Professor** (2008-2013) and a **visiting postdoctoral fellow**
(2013-2017). I have received a diploma, an M.Sc. and a
fellowship-awarded Ph.D. from the same department, specializing in
knowledge management and discovery on the Web.

I am also **adjunct faculty** at the [Hellenic Open
University](https://www.eap.gr/en/) (2015-onwards) and the
[Technological Educational Institution of Western
Greece](http://www.teiwest.gr/index.php/en/) (2007-2014)*.* I have been
teaching a number of [courses](courses/index.html) at the undergraduate
and graduate programs of the [Dpt. of Computer Engineering and
Informatics](http://www.ceid.upatras.gr/), University of Patras, [Dpt.
of Computer Science in Administration and
Economy](http://www.amaliada.teipat.gr/), [Dpt. of Business Planning and
Information Systems](http://bpis.teipat.gr/), [Dpt. of Bussiness
Administration](http://ba.teiwest.gr/), ATEI of Western Greece and
[Business
Administration](http://www.eap.gr/en/courses/114-business-administration/1308-e8b437893d7dfd1b22186d733d9ccaed),
Hellenic Open University. I have also taught postgraduate courses at the
[Computer Science and Engineering
program](https://www.ceid.upatras.gr/en/programma-metaptyhiakon-spoydon-me-titlo-epistimi-kai-tehnologia-ypologiston)
and the [Informatics for Life Sciences Masters
program](http://www.pez.upatras.gr/), joint with the Departments of
Biology, Medicine, Pharmacy and Physics. I have supervised several
student dissertations and masters theses at the departments above. I am
currently co-supervising 2 Ph.D. theses on semantic interoperability and
the evolution of the Web.

For 20 years, I have participated and led a variety of [R&D projects](projects/index.html) with European, national and international funding, focusing on the application and promotion of ICT for the cultural and educational sector. My research interests include big and linked data, digital libraries, knowledge discovery, automated reasoning, metadata integration and the semantic web, where I have published over 80 [research articles and papers](publications/index.html) ([google scholar](https://scholar.google.gr/citations?user=m4iVA70AAAAJ&hl=el&oi=ao)).

I have served as general chair, technical chair and steering committee member in many international conferences and workshops, including [IEEE SWARCH-DL](http://swig.hpclab.ceid.upatras.gr/SWARCH-DL). I am a program committee member and reviewer for over 30 international journals and conferences and the editor of the _Semantic Web Journal_ [special Issue on Semantic Web and Reasoning for Cultural Heritage and Digital Libraries](http://content.iospress.com/journals/semantic-web/3/1). I am the recipient of the National Documentation Center (ΕΚΤ) 1<sup>st</sup> Prize on Applications for Open Data and Repositories for Science & Heritage ([Hack@EKT contest](http://saas.ekt.gr/content/contests), 2015). I am organizing the recent [Int. Workshop on Semantics in the Deep: Semantic Analytics for Big Data (SEDSEAL 2018)](https://sedseal2018.ceid.upatras.gr/) and a related [upcoming special issue of the](http://www.mdpi.com/journal/data/special_issues/Semantic_Analytics) _Data Journal_.
