I am a **tenured** **Lab Lecturer** at the [Department of Computer
Engineering and Informatics](http://www.ceid.upatras.gr/) and a
**research associate** at the [High Performance Information Systems
Laboratory (HPCLab)](../index.html) and the [Pattern Recognition
Laboratory (PRLab)](http://prlab.ceid.upatras.gr/), [University of
Patras](http://www.upatras.gr/). I had formerly been an **Adjunct
Assistant Professor** (2008-2013) and a **visiting postdoctoral fellow**
(2013-2017). I have received a diploma, an M.Sc. and a
fellowship-awarded Ph.D. from the same department, specializing in
knowledge management and discovery on the Web.

I am also **adjunct faculty** at the [Hellenic Open
University](https://www.eap.gr/en/) (2015-onwards) and the
[Technological Educational Institution of Western
Greece](http://www.teiwest.gr/index.php/en/) (2007-2014)*.* I have been
teaching a number of [courses](courses/index.html) at the undergraduate
and graduate programs of the [Dpt. of Computer Engineering and
Informatics](http://www.ceid.upatras.gr/), University of Patras, [Dpt.
of Computer Science in Administration and
Economy](http://www.amaliada.teipat.gr/), [Dpt. of Business Planning and
Information Systems](http://bpis.teipat.gr/), [Dpt. of Bussiness
Administration](http://ba.teiwest.gr/), ATEI of Western Greece and

program](https://www.ceid.upatras.gr/en/programma-metaptyhiakon-spoydon-me-titlo-epistimi-kai-tehnologia-ypologiston)
and the [Informatics for Life Sciences Masters
program](http://www.pez.upatras.gr/), joint with the Departments of
Biology, Medicine, Pharmacy and Physics. I have supervised several
student dissertations and masters theses at the departments above. I am
currently co-supervising 2 Ph.D. theses on semantic interoperability and
the evolution of the Web.
