I am a **tenured** **Lab Lecturer** at the [Department of Computer
Engineering and Informatics](http://www.ceid.upatras.gr/) and a
**research associate** at the [High Performance Information Systems
Laboratory (HPCLab)](../index.html) and the [Pattern Recognition
Laboratory (PRLab)](http://prlab.ceid.upatras.gr/), [University of
Patras](http://www.upatras.gr/). 
I have been
