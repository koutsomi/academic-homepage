I am coordinating the Semantic Web and Interoperability Group ([SWIGroup](http://swig.hpclab.ceid.upatras.gr/)), where I am working on the development of software and models related to Semantic Web technologies  and standards, including:

- a prototype [framework](http://swig.hpclab.ceid.upatras.gr/OWLApp) for decentralized reasoning services on the Semantic Web,
- the [implementation](http://swig.hpclab.ceid.upatras.gr/SKOS) of the multilingual *Thesaurus of Greek Terms* using the Simple Knowledge Organization Systems (SKOS) model and the Ontology Web Language (OWL),
- a technical [report](http://swig.hpclab.ceid.upatras.gr/SKOS/Skos2Owl2)on expressing SKOS in OWL 2,
- the [implementation ](http://swig.hpclab.ceid.upatras.gr/SWIGroupPapers/CRMinOWL)of CIDOC-CRM in OWL,
- an [initiative](http://swig.hpclab.ceid.upatras.gr/SSEvaluationAppendix) for the evaluation of semantic query answering in digital repositories.
- a [Linked Data model](http://swig.hpclab.ceid.upatras.gr/SWIGroupPapers/BookShop) for matchmaking user preferences with book      offers in online bookstores.
- an [ontology model](https://webprotege.stanford.edu/download?project=a5b329e1-ae76-45c0-a227-21476f74c0ea) to support semantic analytics on Big Data in the insurance industry.
- development of various upper- and domain-level ontologies for culture, education and manufacturing.
- a [framework](https://github.com/swigroup/dspace-semantic-search/wiki) for semantic-based querying and navigation in digital repositories, which has been awarded the 1st Prize at the National Documentation Center contest *on Applications for Open Data and Repositories for Science & Heritage (*[Hack@EKT](http://saas.ekt.gr/content/contests)*).*
- A [service](http://snf-630087.vm.okeanos.grnet.gr:8888/SemanticMiddleware-1.1/results?q=medicine) for federated semantic search, classification and harvesting of Open Educational Resources over multiple repositories.
- Other recent projects include semantic analytics for Big Data, Linked Data and ontologies for e-Learning.
