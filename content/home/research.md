For 20 years, I have participated and led a variety of [R&D projects](projects/index.html) with European, national and international funding, focusing on the application and promotion of ICT for the cultural and educational sector. My research interests include big and linked data, digital libraries, knowledge discovery, automated reasoning, metadata integration and the semantic web, where I have published over 80 [research articles and papers](publications/index.html) ([google scholar](https://scholar.google.gr/citations?user=m4iVA70AAAAJ&hl=el&oi=ao)).
