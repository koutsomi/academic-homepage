For 20 years, I have participated and led a variety of [R&D projects](projects/index.html) with European, national and international funding, focusing on the application and promotion of ICT for the cultural and educational sector. My research interests include big and linked data, digital libraries, knowledge discovery, automated reasoning, metadata integration and the semantic web, where I have published over 80 [research articles and papers](publications/index.html) ([google scholar](https://scholar.google.gr/citations?user=m4iVA70AAAAJ&hl=el&oi=ao)).

I have served as general chair, technical chair and steering committee member in many international conferences and workshops, including [IEEE SWARCH-DL](http://swig.hpclab.ceid.upatras.gr/SWARCH-DL). I am a program committee member and reviewer for over 30 international journals and conferences and the editor of the _Semantic Web Journal_ [special Issue on Semantic Web and Reasoning for Cultural Heritage and Digital Libraries](http://content.iospress.com/journals/semantic-web/3/1). I am the recipient of the National Documentation Center (ΕΚΤ) 1<sup>st</sup> Prize on Applications for Open Data and Repositories for Science & Heritage ([Hack@EKT contest](http://saas.ekt.gr/content/contests), 2015). I am organizing the recent [Int. Workshop on Semantics in the Deep: Semantic Analytics for Big Data (SEDSEAL 2018)](https://sedseal2018.ceid.upatras.gr/) and a related [upcoming special issue of the](http://www.mdpi.com/journal/data/special_issues/Semantic_Analytics) _Data Journal_.
